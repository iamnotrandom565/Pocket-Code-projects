# Pocket Code projects

Yeah, I know that the Pocket Code community is dead right now, but I'm on a mission to kinda revive it by making bangers.

## Projects

### How to install

1. Get Pocket Code from a trusted source (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, etc...)
2. Go to "My Projects", then click the three dots at the top right corner, and on the dropdown, click "Import".
3. Click on one of my projects that you downloaded, and wait until it finishes importing

And you're ready to go!

### Idle Number

Idle Number is a minimalist clicker + idle game that is 300 kilobytes (in fact, half of it is just for one audio for a *nice* Easter Egg). You can figure the rest out, because the game is so simple and easy to pick up and play.
